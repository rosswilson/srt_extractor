1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,808
Associated with for five
generations.

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:07,108
What your dog called? Nellie.

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,787
She's beautiful. Has she always
been on board?

4
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:11,387
Pretty much, yes, she comes to work.

5
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:13,498
Customers love,
especially the children.

6
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:17,476
Dani, how long have you and your family
been involved in the ferry crossing?

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:21,702
The first member of my family
was involved was in the late 1800s.

8
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,778
He is my great, great uncle,
Benjamin Cross.

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,399
Then, basically, a member of my family
has been doing it ever since then.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,801
I gather the ferry's been running
a lot longer than that?

11
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:35,938
Yes, the first recorded crossing was
1236 - that's nearly 800 years ago.

12
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,488
At that time it was a rowing boat
and they used to charge ha'penny

13
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,688
per person and per horse.

14
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,697
Goodness how they rowed
a horse across, I don't know.

15
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:49,080
Has it always been a rowing boat?
Initially, it was a rowing boat.

16
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,699
They did try to build
a bridge in the 1800s.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,117
The Harbour Commissioners wanted to
do that but it was too expensive.

18
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,840
They decided to put in a pontoon
chain ferry,

19
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,049
which would take two cars at a time.
Sure.

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,807
A lot of locals were living here
and that was the only way across

21
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:05,257
because there was no bridge
further up. Yeah.

22
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:12,703
The pontoon ferry from the 1880s
was in turn replaced by a new

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,328
and improved steam ferry
in the 1920s called The Blyth.

24
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,628
How long did the chain ferry last?

25
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,974
What happened in the Second world
war, the army used to come across

26
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:24,408
but they didn't pay.

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,481
The service went into disrepair
because there was no money. Yeah.

28
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:30,318
They moored it up and then,
eventually,

29
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,720
the pontoon just sort of ended up
sitting on the mud

30
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,222
and that was the end of that.

31
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:39,420
After hundreds of years
of crossings, both communities

32
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,141
were cut off from each other but
Dani's family came to the rescue.

33
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,598
In 1940, her great,
great-uncle, Old Bob Cross,

34
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,618
enlisted his brother, Ernie.

35
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:53,048
Together, using a fishing boat,

36
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:57,429
they resurrected the old rowing boat
service, which still operates today.

37
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,713
So who took over from Bob and Ernie?
That was Young Bob, Old Bob's son.

38
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,788
He did the ferry in the 1970s
and 19805.

39
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:17,069
He became a bit of a celebrity because, at that time,
the ferry turned from a necessity to a novelty

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,716
and even made the front page of the
New York Times at one point. Really?

41
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:24,845
He became quite a celebrity.
Local hero? Something like that.

42
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,049
When did your father get involved?

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,047
From about the age of 12,
he started helping his great grandad,

44
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,690
who was Old Bob, on the ferry

45
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,639
and he taught him the tricks
of the trade and Bob and Dad

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,610
they were quite famous for their
smoked fish - kippers and herrings,

47
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:39,698
because they had a smokehouse.

48
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,137
It was one of the things do
around here, really? Yeah.

49
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:45,137
When did your father start to
teach you to row?

50
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:48,046
I can't really remember, it must've
been from six or seven.

51
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:51,845
I used to sit on the boat with him and watch
him talk to the customers, stroke the dogs

52
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,517
and gradually he would let me
take one oar and then I would

53
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:58,076
sit on his lap and do them together
and he would teach me the tides.

54
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,689
I've basically grown-up knowing
all about the ferry and how it works.

55
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,161
It literally is handed
down from father to daughter? Yeah.

56
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,787
And you obviously clearly get
job satisfaction,

57
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,989
I can see you're really
passionate about it.

58
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,077
I think it's working outdoors, for
me, is wonderful and the exercise.

59
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,720
Also, meeting the people.

60
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,408
There are so many people
who come over.

61
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,986
From year to year you gain
your friends and the customers,

62
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:22,125
you see them every year and you get to
know what's going on in their lives.

63
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,201
It's the continuity
that I really enjoy.

64
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,270
Dani's keen to keep
the tradition alive

65
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,671
and not one to keep her passengers
waiting.

66
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,758
Jump on. Morning, everyone.

67
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,268
Some regulars have turned up to get
across, including Rita and her grandson.

68
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:39,708
So, Rita, how long
have you been using the ferry?

69
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,185
I've been using
the ferry for 61 years now.

70
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,298
Gosh, you don't look old enough!

71
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,996
You must have been born in the boat!

72
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:50,388
I was born in walberswick.
I was born in the village. Right.

73
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,339
My mother still lives here.
What about you? I built the ferry.

74
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,380
You built this ferry?
You're a shipwright, aren't you?

75
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:00,100
That's correct. A lovely trade.
Yeah. Gosh!

76
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,150
What do you think of Dani
continuing the family tradition?

77
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:06,860
Southwold without the ferry
wouldn't be Southwold, would it?

78
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,188
It's got to have a ferry.

79
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,898
The first one I built
was 61 years ago.

80
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:14,058
I have never rowed the boat.

81
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,847
Are you...? No.
It's never too late, is it?

82
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,978
THEY LAUGH

83
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,438
It's not too late for Dani's son,
Charlie, or nephew, Oscar.

84
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,921
Are you going to take over
the business one day? No, Oscar is.

85
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,388
Is he? Yeah.

86
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,734
I want to do something different.
You want to do something different!

87
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:35,404
ALL LAUGH

88
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,501
well, I can't think of a better
way to travel

89
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:44,248
and make friends at the same time.

90
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,778
Nellie, are you going to jump over?

91
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,998
Long may the tradition
of the Southwold

92
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,346
to walberswick ferry continue.

93
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,998
Yes, there's a lot of people,
isn't there?

94
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,923
Welcome back to lckworth House.

95
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,960
And, at the valuation table,

96
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:09,158
Adam's about to get a bit
of religious education.

97
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,158
Damaris. Your name is Damaris?

98
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,608
It is. Damaris, that's a very
unusual name.

99
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:17,172
It comes from the book of Acts
in the Bible. It's a biblical name.

100
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,018
Damaris was a follower of Saint Paul.

101
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,501
Have you met any others?
I met one once, I taught one once.

102
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,768
Where did you get this copper from?

103
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:30,138
When I was first married
which was in 1964,

104
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,498
we wanted a coal bucket
and we went to the local market.

105
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:37,560
Where was that, then? In Clitheroe.
Clitheroe!

106
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,695
Are you a Lancashire lady?
Yes, I'm from that area. Very good.

107
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:43,649
We saw this but, of course,
it was all black and horrible

108
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,136
and I didn't realise
what it would look like.

109
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,615
Yes, it's come up beautifully,
hasn't it?

110
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,947
I've cleaned it ever since. Have you?
I've always cleaned it, yes.

111
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:54,250
Do remember what it cost you? I do.

112
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,980
That's a Lancashire lady for you.

113
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,472
Dare I tell you? All right.
Ten shillings.

114
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:02,248
<i>That's not that much, is it'!
No, Sop. Sop'.!</i>

115
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,946
It was a lot then, though.
Of course it was.

116
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,688
I wanted to know really
how old it was.

117
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,358
Well, that's an easy one, really,

118
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,478
because of the style
of decoration to it.

119
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,200
It's very much the Art Nouveau,
Arts and Crafts style.

120
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,718
I thought it was Arts and Crafts.
Yeah, it's sort of 1900s... Yes.

121
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,791
...where this was very popular.

122
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,328
You've got this stylised flower
heads and these

123
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,405
spades from club suits, aren't they?

124
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,972
There are a number of designers that
made these, sort of, things.

125
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,258
There was Voysey and Benson

126
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,298
and there was the
Newlyn school of copper.

127
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,668
Yes, I wondered about that.

128
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,438
Have you seen any markings on it
when you've been cleaning? No.

129
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,996
You'll be more familiar with this than
anybody. No, I've never found a marking.

130
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,337
I think it's going to be
indeterminate as to where it

131
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,253
was made but it's very likely
to have been made

132
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,768
in the Cumbria's metal workshops.

133
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,598
It might be Keswick?

134
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,048
It certainly an Arts and Crafts,
Art Nouveau, 1900 coal bucket.

135
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,958
It cost 10 shillings. Today's value?

136
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,428
One man I talked to thought
it might be 80 to 100.

137
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,830
I think it'd make a bit
over 100, really

138
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:08,359
but 80 to 100 is about
the right estimate.

139
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,165
How would you feel about that?
Yes, that's all right. Is it?

140
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,368
I've found out something about it
and that's really why I brought it.

141
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:18,618
Well, that's right and if it makes
a good price, 150, 160...

142
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:21,048
Even better.
It would, wouldn't it?

143
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,599
I'll buy something I like
that I don't need.

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,549
Something you like, that you don't
need. Like a piece of jewellery.

145
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,776
A luxury item? Yes. Very good. Lots
of people are going to like that.

146
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:33,437
Yeah. Fingers crossed, Damaris.
Thanks for coming. Thank you.

147
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:37,286
Well, let's hope Damaris can treat
herself to something special.

148
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:43,235
Now, where is this intriguing
box of Sheila's been hiding?

149
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:46,711
They've been stuck in a cupboard. Are
they family things? Auntie Bessie's.

150
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:50,918
Who's Auntie Bessie?
Auntie Bessie died in '97.

151
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,168
She was in her early 90s.

152
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,426
And she used to collect everything,

153
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:58,517
and when she died the immediate
family got the house but,

154
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,170
because I'd looked after her a lot,

155
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,868
me and another cousin
had the contents.

156
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,860
Oh, that's nice. Tell me about her.

157
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:08,818
Well, she used to be a photographer,
and during the war,

158
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,736
when the main photographer
had to go away, she took over,

159
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:15,632
and when they brought the German
generals to windermere, because

160
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:20,208
there must have been a camp there,
nobody had to take photographs,

161
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,898
so she climbed a tree

162
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,437
and I've got the photographs
of the German generals.

163
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,039
She was a real character.
So is this Auntie Bessie's?

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,926
That was Auntie Bessie's. Let's look
and see what we've got. Good idea.

165
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,879
It's going to be a canteen of...
Oh, those are nice, aren't they?

166
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,305
They are beautiful. These are fruit
knives and forks. Yeah.

167
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,978
But it's a set of eight.

168
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,498
You either have six or 12,
you don't have eight.

169
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:47,039
I don't know that I've ever seen
a set of eight fruit knives

170
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,044
and forks. No, I haven't.
These are mother-of-pearl handles.

171
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,418
Sheffield hallmark for 1930. Right.

172
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,097
And they are hallmarked
by Cooper Brothers.

173
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:58,195
But the thing I find really
interesting about these

174
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:02,538
is I wouldn't think these had
ever been used. No.

175
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,840
And now someone will probably buy
them, take them home, think they are

176
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:09,396
really lovely, put them in a drawer
and they will never get used.

177
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:12,632
And these will spend their life
never being used.

178
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,227
Yeah, in a drawer. Yeah.

179
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,705
Sad, isn't it? It's very sad, yeah.
They are beautiful.

180
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,272
So what are they going to make,
do you think? I haven't a clue.

181
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:25,088
Well, because they are not going to
be used, they are almost useless,

182
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,048
I think you should estimate
them at £50-£80

183
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:32,271
and put a reserve of 40 quid
on them. That's what I think. Yeah.

184
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,426
And it would be nice
if somebody bought Bessie's

185
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:36,400
fruit knives and forks...
And used them...

186
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,279
and actually got some
use out of them.

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,277
That would be lovely, wouldn't it?
We need somebody in a big house.

188
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,375
Absolutely right. A castle.
Keep our fingers crossed.

189
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,839
And talking of big houses,
we couldn't come to lckworth,

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,756
now owned by the National Trust,

191
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:56,151
without taking a closer look
inside the glorious rotunda.

192
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:00,492
The fourth Earl of Bristol,
who commissioned lckworth,

193
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:04,188
had two passions,
building and collecting.

194
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,048
The Earl was obsessed with fine art
and antiques, which he

195
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:07,106
picked up on his travels over the

196
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,895
picked up on his travels over the
years on the grand tour of Europe.

197
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:15,206
And the house was designed to
show off the fruits of his labour.

198
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:19,113
But sadly, the collection was
destined to remain in Europe.

199
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:24,348
It was confiscated by
Napoleonic troops in Rome in 1798

200
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:27,256
and the Earl spent the remaining
years of his life

201
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,331
campaigning for its restitution.

202
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,517
But all was not lost.
Just take a look at this sculpture.

203
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:41,878
It was commissioned by the Earl when
he met the artist in Rome in 1790.

204
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,408
It depicts the Fury Of Athamas.

205
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:44,466
According to Greek legend,

206
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:48,438
According to Greek legend,
in a fit of madness,

207
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,100
Athamas murdered his son.

208
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,128
His wife and their remaining son

209
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,999
then threw themselves into the sea
to escape his fury.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,475
It was confiscated by
the Napoleonic troops

211
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,790
along with the rest
of the collection.

212
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,708
His son, the first Marquis,
was able to buy it back.

213
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,946
It's one of the few works of art
originally picked up by the Earl

214
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:12,263
that actually made it back here
to lckworth, and I must say it makes

215
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:16,811
the most marvellous focal point
here in this magnificent rotunda.

216
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:23,811
I'm sure the Earl would be pleased
to see all the collectables

217
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:26,986
being brought along
to the west wing today.

218
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,636
Well, Ian, it's always interesting

219
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:33,270
to see swords coming in
to the programme.

220
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,980
Whenever we have a military
sale at my auction room,

221
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,418
it's amazing how many people have
got swords and guns

222
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,050
and things tucked away that they
feel is a liability

223
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,498
and don't know what to do with.

224
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,708
Can you tell me
where you got them from

225
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:47,418
and why you decided to bring them
to Flog It?

226
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,198
They were my father-in-law's

227
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,638
and my mother-in-law said
she didn't want them to go to

228
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,446
the youngest grandson because she was
afraid he might cut himself. OK.

229
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,069
So they were given to me and I've had
them for about ten years,

230
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,929
just sat in an umbrella stand.
I'm not a sword man.

231
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,677
I'd rather they went to someone
who would appreciate them. Yeah.

232
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:07,400
Well, they are the sort of thing
that tends to get hidden

233
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:10,397
under the bed in a blanket
or on top of the wardrobe or in

234
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,679
an umbrella stand, because people don't
know what to do with them. Exactly.

235
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,815
But there is also a very keen
interest in militaria these days.

236
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,168
And a lot of people
would like to own these,

237
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:21,645
have them hanging on the wall
or in a cabinet.

238
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:25,206
People watching are going to say
they are a pair. They are not.

239
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:28,271
There are slight differences.
There are slight differences,

240
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:33,028
but they are both light cavalry
swords, 1821 pattern.

241
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:37,108
This one here is Royal Horse
Artillery and these will be of

242
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,749
the Victorian period, early
Victorian period,

243
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,888
so about 1850, I'd imagine.

244
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,635
Nice to see them in good condition.

245
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:46,075
The decoration on the blades
is crisp. It's lovely.

246
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:49,998
Yeah, there's no rusting
and the wire-bound handles,

247
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,805
do you know what that material is?
Shagreen, I think. Very good.

248
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,386
Yeah, sharkskin, shagreen handles.
So quite a luxury item.

249
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,589
These are an officer's sword.
I would think so.

250
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,401
They never saw any actual action,
I would have thought.

251
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:05,669
They are more a dress officer's
sword. So that's the first one.

252
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,658
And the second one,
very, very similar.

253
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,400
The same pattern and design.

254
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:13,825
This one's been pulled in
and out of the scabbard a bit more,

255
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,578
had a bit more action.

256
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,934
In fact I can smell the oil on them
still. Still?

257
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:22,248
Yeah, I just caught
a whiff of it there.

258
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:26,098
So, like I said, there's a very
ready market for them.

259
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,255
What you think they are worth?
Any ideas?

260
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:31,826
Well, I honestly thought
they were probably 1930, 1940,

261
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:35,255
ceremonial dress swords,
brought out for trooping the colour.

262
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:37,858
And I thought 20 quid? OK.

263
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,941
Well, there's a nice
surprise for you, really.

264
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:44,568
They are worth about 150 quid each.
What?! Yeah, I think so. Each?

265
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,998
Yes. They are quite a... I like
that reaction! You can come again.

266
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:53,289
They are nice. There are in good
condition, pretty much.

267
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,375
I suggest put them together and
an estimate combined of £300-£400.

268
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,268
Wow. So... Happy with that?
Very happy.

269
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,250
I think we should put
a reserve on them,

270
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,007
so let's put 300 on them,
shall we? Yeah, no problem.

271
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:07,970
That gives them every chance...
To go. To go.

272
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,445
Thanks for bringing them
in and fingers crossed,

273
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:14,307
as the swords are crossed, for a good result.
Good. Thanks very much. Thank you. Cheers.

274
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,148
And that lovely surprise for Ian
rounds up today's items.

275
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,530
Well, there you are, three more
items to take off to auction,

276
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:27,615
which means it's time to say goodbye
to our magnificent host location,

277
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,758
lckworth House,

278
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,470
and the marvellous architectural
delight of the Rotunda.

279
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,669
We had a brilliant day here,
but let's make our way

280
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,310
over to Diss, to the
auction room for the last time.

281
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,868
And here's what's coming with us.

282
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,691
There's the Arts And Crafts
copper coal bucket,

283
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:47,798
found in Clitheroe market
for ten shillings.

284
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,780
Will Auntie Bessie's
canteen of fruit knives and forks

285
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:55,348
find rich pickings
amongst the bidders?

286
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,817
And finally.
